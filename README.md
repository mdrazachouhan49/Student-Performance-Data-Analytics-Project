# Student Performance Analysis and Prediction

## Project Summary
This project presents an end to end machine learning workflow focused on analyzing and predicting student academic performance. Using structured educational data, the project applies data analysis, preprocessing, and supervised learning techniques to identify key factors influencing outcomes and to build reliable predictive models.

The emphasis of this project is on clarity, correctness, and industry aligned methodology rather than unnecessary model complexity.

## Key Objectives
- Understand patterns and distributions in student performance data
- Identify academic and demographic factors impacting outcomes
- Build interpretable and stable machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate statistical metrics
- Demonstrate a complete, production style ML workflow

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains student level information including:
- Gender and demographic attributes
- Parental education background
- Study related characteristics
- Academic performance indicators and scores

The target variable represents student performance and is modeled using supervised learning approaches.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Performed descriptive statistics to understand central tendency and spread
- Analyzed feature distributions and class balance
- Examined relationships between input features and student outcomes
- Visualized key trends using histograms, box plots, and correlation analysis

EDA helped validate assumptions, detect potential biases, and guide preprocessing decisions.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques
- Applied feature scaling where required to improve model stability
- Ensured clean train test separation to avoid data leakage
- Prepared final feature sets for modeling

The preprocessing pipeline was designed to be reproducible and model agnostic.

## Model Evaluation
Depending on the task, the following metrics were used:
- R squared for explanatory power
- Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error for prediction quality

Evaluation results were analyzed critically rather than relying on raw metric values.
